# ai-interviewer-video-module

This repository contains a blueprint implementation of the **AI Interviewer Vision** module. The code lives under [`ai-interviewer-vision/`](ai-interviewer-vision/) and exposes a minimal FastAPI application with placeholder implementations for face detection, liveness analysis and deepfake detection.

The project is intended as a starting point for further development and is not production ready.
